# ottolotto.io platform games smart contracts
 		
[Ottlotto.io](https://ottolotto.io) is the most advanced gaming platform in the world, which uses modern technologies of smart contracts and security advantages of blockchain.

This is the most honest and transparent gaming portal of all . Users play not against the organization (the host of the platform), but with each other - this is a new approach and a look at the industry. We do not control the process of drawing and giving out prizes - it is fully automated and executed by a smart contract.

Our advantages are the use of blockchain technology, which makes the process of the game transparent, in comparison to classic games and lotteries. Our team also invented a unique way to calculate a winning combination that uses block hashes from the blockchain. This allows you to make the draw public and absolutely unpredictable.


We created the first online gaming platform, games on which are implemented in the form of smart contracts. Users make bets and play with each other, money is stored in a smart contract on a blockchain and no person can change or forge the results, because The core of the blockchain is the cryptographic protocol and all the data is processed by millions of computers around the world. At the same time, information about bets and draws is open on the site [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/), each player (and anyone else) can check the game progress, the results of previous games and for each bet at any time.

All games on our platform use a hash from the Ethereum blockchain. It can not be foreseen. Each game on the platform uses the hash data in its own way, thereby providing the user with a transparent prize draw scheme.

## King's Loto
In fact, it’s the most transparent and fair [lottery](https://ottolotto.io/en/kings-loto) in the world! Player buys a ticket with cryptocurrency and chooses his 6 lucky numbers (from 0 to 15). Twice a week (Tuesday and Friday) lottery should start from the block hash, which was set in advance in the draw info. We’ll take the last number of each hash (this is exactly that ball, which is used in the regular lottery). Six hashes - six lucky numbers in the end. Then smart-contract is processing the draw 
information and sends all prizes automatically to the winners' wallets! One ticket plays twice - in regular lottery draw and in the Grand Jackpot draw on the 21st of December. This means somebody will receive all money for sure!
